# 📈 COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

A Python-based data analysis system designed to analyze and visualize recovery and fatality rates across major Indian states. This project showcases data engineering and visualization skills using Pandas and Matplotlib.

## 🚀 Key Features
-- Structured Data Pipeline
-- Implements modular functions such as load_data() and calculate_rates() for clean, reusable code.

-- Mathematical Analysis
   Automatically computes Recovery Percentage and Fatality Percentage to enable meaningful state-wise comparisons.

-- Visual Reporting
   Generates a professional bar chart and saves the output directly to the /output folder for easy access.
   
## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
