# 📈 COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

A Python-based system to analyze and visualize the recovery and fatality rates across major Indian states. This project demonstrates data engineering skills using **Pandas** and **Matplotlib**.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Data Pipeline:** Organized code using modular functions (`load_data`, `calculate_rates`).

- **Mathematical Modeling:** Automated calculation of Recovery % and Fatality % for comparative analysis.

- **Reporting:** Generates a professional bar chart saved directly to an `/output` folder.

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run analysis: `python covid_analysis.py`
